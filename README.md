# calcium-microdomain

This repository contains code for a simulation of a presynaptic terminal, where we model a Calcium microdomain using a simple multi-compartment model based off the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. 


## TODO

- [x] Compartment 1 is active when a "action potential" is fed in
- [ ] Compartment 2 mirrors Comp 1
- [ ] Add in Calcium channels
- [ ] Add Calcium dependence of K+ channels
